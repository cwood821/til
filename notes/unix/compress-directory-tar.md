# Compress a directory with `tar`

The `tar` commands compresses files together. You can compress a directory, including all its files, by running:

```
tar -zcvf archive-name.tar.gz directory-name
```

`z` compresses with gzip, `c` creates an archive, `v` turns on verbose output, `f` represents the archive file name.
