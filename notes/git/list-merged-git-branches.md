# List branches merged (or not) with current branch 

If you manage multiple feature branches, you may need to check which branches have been fully merged into your current working branch. 

To see which branches have been merged into the current branch, use: 

```
git branch --merge
```

List the branches not merged with: 

```
git branch --no-merged
```

For more information, read [the documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch).
