# Get color depth of screen

To get the color depth of the screen in JavaScript, use the  `screen.colorDepth` property.

Per [the specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-screen-colordepth):
> The colorDepth and pixelDepth attributes should return the number of bits allocated to colors for a pixel in the output device, excluding the alpha channel. 

Read [the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen/colorDepth). Read [about color depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth).
