## List tables and show schema from SQLite cli

In the [SQLite cli](https://sqlite.org/cli.html), many commands are dot-prefixed. 

To see a list of tables:

```SQLite
.tables
```

To see the schema of a table:

```
.schema TABLENAME
```

Read the [official documentation](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) for more detail. Hat tip to this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/82875/how-to-list-the-tables-in-a-sqlite-database-file-that-was-opened-with-attach#answer-82899).
