## See table schema with `describe`

In MySQL, use the `describe` or `explain` statement to see the schema of a table. 

```sql
use MyDatabase;
describe users;
```

This is useful for exploring existing databases from the command line. 

Read the [official documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/explain.html).
