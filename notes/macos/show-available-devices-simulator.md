# List available devices and runtimes in the Simulator App

With XCode command line tools installed, run:

```
xcrun simctl list
```

Accoring to the the manual, this will "List available devices, device types, runtimes, or device pairs."

Pairing this command with the `delete` command can help clear out unnused runtimes and free up drive space.
