# Deque 

A double-ended queue (deque) is a generalized queue. 

Depending on implementation, you may be able to insert or delete at either end in constant time. 

Read more on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue). Hat tip to [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/complexity2/html/thinkcomplexity2004.html#sec31) for introducing this data structure.

The Python Standard Library provides a deque via the [collections module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque).
