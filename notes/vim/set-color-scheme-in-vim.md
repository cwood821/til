# Set the color scheme in Vim with the colorscheme command

Set the color scheme for syntax highlighting in vim:
```
colorscheme delek
```

Shorthand
```
colo delek
```

To turn on syntax highlighting, set the syntax setting to on in your `.vimrc` file:
```
syntax on
```

Available color schemes are stored in the `/usr/share/vim/vim72/` on Mac.

I learned this from [Alvin Alexander's site](https://alvinalexander.com/linux/vi-vim-editor-color-scheme-colorscheme).
